# Charcuterie_Calculator

The purpose of this application is to display charcuterie recipes to a user via their browser. Each recipe page will allow them to enter the total amount of product they would like to make, and run a calculation that displays the recipe based on that total weight.

Sausage recipes are calculated based on the weight of the meat in grams. For instance, if I have 2000g of pork shoulder - I would add 1.5% salt of the total weight - which means I add 30g of salt. The next time I make this recipe I may only have 1555g of pork shoulder - so this time I would only add 23.32g of salt.

An administrator will have the option to add new recipes, delete or edit old ones. The administrator will use the login screen to login, their username and hashed password is stored in the database. Their access will be stored in PHP session variables which are the verified on any administrator php file.
