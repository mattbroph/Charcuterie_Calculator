# Charcuterie_Calculator

The purpose of this application is to display charcuterie recipes to a user via their browser. Each recipe page will allow them to enter the total amount of product they would like to make, and run a calculation that displays the recipe based on that total weight.

Sausage recipes are calculated based on the weight of the meat in grams. For instance, if I have 2000g of pork shoulder - I would add 1.5% salt of the total weight - which means I add 30g of salt. The next time I make this recipe I may only have 1555g of pork shoulder - so this time I would only add 23.32g of salt.

An administrator will have the option to add new recipes, delete or edit old ones.
